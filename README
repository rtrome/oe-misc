My Personal Yocto Layer for Experimentation and Doodling
========================================================

This is my "play" layer; a layer for learning and experimentation
with the Yocto Project. It's also a good place to keep my various
nuggets of information (notes, tips, documentation, ...).

This layer depends on:

URI:		git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
branch:		master
revision:	HEAD

URI: 		git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
branch:		master
revision:	HEAD

This layer is maintained by:
