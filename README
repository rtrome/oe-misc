My Personal Yocto Layer for Experimentation and Doodling
========================================================

This is my "play" layer; a layer for learning and experimentation
with the Yocto Project. It's also a good place to keep my various
nuggets of information (notes, tips, documentation, ...).

This layer depends on:

URI:		git://git.yoctoproject.org/poky
branch:		master
revision:	HEAD

URI: 		git://git.openembedded.org/meta-openembedded
branch:		master
revision:	HEAD

This layer is maintained by:

	Trevor Woerner <twoerner@gmail.com>


QT5 Application Demo
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
In this layer I have also provided a sample recipe for building a (copied)
sample qt5 application.

I say "copied" because I want to make clear that this is something that
is provided as one of the sample qt5 applications and isn't something I
personally wrote from scratch. The (copied) sample qt5 application comes
from the qt5 help documentation and is named "textfinder". The recipe builds
the code by finding it on my github account here:
	https://github.com/twoerner/textfinder
You can find more information about this sample qt5 application here:
	http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtuitools/textfinder.html

I have, by necessity, provided two branches of this meta-trevor layer: one for
the master branch and one for dylan. If you want to try building this layer's
master textfinder application you need to make sure all the other layers are
also on their master branches. The same holds true for this layer's dylan
branch.

To experiment with building textfinder you'll need the following layers (in
addition to this one):
	meta-poky/meta
	meta-poky/meta-yocto
	meta-poky/meta-yocto-bsp
	meta-openembedded/meta-ruby
	meta-qt5

Then, in your conf/local.conf, add:
	IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " textfinder"

Then run:
	$ bitbake core-image-x11

Once your image is running, simply call the following to run the application:
	# textfinder
