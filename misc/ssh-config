When using 'runqemu' the IP address of the VM will always be the same, however
each new build of the image will cause new server SSH keys to be generated.
Between connecting to new images you will have to run something like:

	$ ssh-keygen -R 192.168.7.2 -f /home/trevor/.ssh/known_hosts

Or you could put something along the following into your ~/.ssh/config:

	Host yimage
		HostName 192.168.7.2
		StrictHostKeyChecking no
		UserKnownHostsFile /dev/null
		User root
